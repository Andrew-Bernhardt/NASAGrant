# NASA Space Grant Purpose
Through a grant approval from the NASA SC Space Grant Consortium, I have been able to teach game design to high schoolers across South Carolina.
This codebase is being used as supplmentary material to assist with a live lesson and teaching that I provide on behalf of this grant

## What Students will learn ##
The students that I am presenting to will learn how to use the Godot game engine to change a game and customize it. This is designed as an introductory level of how coding works and how programmers will think.

## What Students will Do ##
- Customize the font/text in a game
- Change the backdrop for games
- Upload/edit custom Character sprites
- Edit the Map to make custom levels in their game
